**New minor version version::``0.2.0-beta`` of ¨tnsgeo:** see the changes below.


**Criteria of colinearity:** a new macro ``\colicriteria`` shows crossing products instead of the loops used for the 2D determinant of two vectors in a plane.


**New ¨api for the cross products:** there is one little important change and a new feature.

    1) ``\vcalccrossprod*`` becomes ``\vcalccrossprod**``.

    1) ``\vcalccrossprod*`` prints crossing products instead of loops.


**Documentation:** examples of use of ¨siuntix shows how to write degrees or radians easily.


**Internal machinery:** two things have changed.

    1) The cross product have been integrated to ¨tnscom because the codes used are very similar to the ones used for the 2D determinant.

    1) An update have been done regarding the other new ¨api of ``\tns@det@plane@deco``.

**Internal machinery for the documentation:** the ¨python file path::``build-01-dep[slow].py`` updates automatically a ¨tex file with all the packages used by ¨tnsgeo.

**Internal machinery for the technical ¨infos:** the printing uses now ¨macroenvsign the new version of ¨cbdevtools (this tool is still in alpha version).

**New sub minor version version::``0.1.1-beta`` of ¨tnsgeo:** there was a problem due to the use of the ¨tikz library ``babel``
((
    This bug was discovered when trying to integrate ¨tnsgeo into ¨tnsmath.
)).
This has been fixed.


**Internal machinery for the technical ¨infos:** the builder is better but still not the best one...

**New minor version version::``0.1.0-beta`` of ¨tnsgeo:** see the changes below.


**Dot product :** ``\dotprod`` et ``\vdotprod`` have the new options.

    1) ``p`` and ``sp`` are for a version using parenthesis.

    1) ``b`` prints a bullet instead of a centered dot.


**Cross product :** ``\crossprod`` and ``\vcrossprod`` have now an optional argument suchas to obtain another formating using the symbol ``\times``.


**Internal machinery for the calculation of a cross product :** `\tns@prop@prod` is used to make the code easier to read.

**First version version::``0.0.0-beta`` of ¨tnsgeo:** this package contains macros to write efficiently standard geometry.

warning::
    This package uses the package `tnscom`.
